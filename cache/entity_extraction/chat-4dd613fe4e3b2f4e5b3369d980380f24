Larger Testing\nWritten by Joseph Graves\nEdited by Tom Manshreck\nIn previous chapters, we have recounted how a testing culture was\nestablished at Google and how small unit tests became a fundamental part of\nthe developer workflow. But what about other kinds of tests? It turns out that\nGoogle does indeed use many larger tests and these comprise a significant\npart of the risk mitigation strategy necessary for healthy software\nengineering. But these tests present additional challenges to ensure that they\nare valuable assets and not resource sinks. In this chapter, we\u2019ll discuss what\nwe mean by \u201clarger tests,\u201d when we execute them, and best practices for\nkeeping them effective.\n\nWhat are Larger Tests?\nAs mentioned previously, Google has specific notions of test size. Small tests\nare restricted to one thread, one process, one machine. Larger tests do not\nhave the same restrictions. But Google also has notions of test scope. A unit\ntest necessarily is of smaller scope than an integration test. And the largestscoped tests (sometimes called end-to-end or system tests) typically involve\nseveral real dependencies and fewer test doubles.\nLarger tests are many things that small tests are not. They are not bound by\nthe same constraints; thus, they can exhibit the following characteristics:\n\n\nThey may be slow. Our large tests have a default timeout of 15 minutes\nor 1 hour, but we also have tests that run for multiple hours or even\ndays.\n\n\n\nThey may be\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
