Consider a\ntimeline of the developer workflow for a feature that progresses from left to\nright, starting from conception and design, progressing through\nimplementation, review, testing, commit, canary, and eventual production\ndeployment. Shifting problem detection to the \u201cleft,\u201d earlier on this timeline,\nmakes it cheaper to fix than waiting longer, as shown in Figure 1-2.\nThis term seems to have originated from arguments that security mustn\u2019t be\ndeferred until the end of the development process, with requisite calls to\n\u201cshift left on security.\u201d The argument in this case is relatively simple: if a\nsecurity problem is discovered only after your product has gone to\nproduction, you have a very expensive problem. If it were caught before\ndeploying to production, it may still take a lot of work to identify and remedy\nthe problem, but it\u2019s cheaper. If you can catch it before the original developer\ncommits the flaw to version control, it\u2019s even cheaper: they already have an\nunderstanding of the feature; revising according to new security constraints is\ncheaper than committing and forcing someone else to triage it and fix it.\n\n\fFigure 1-2. Timeline of the developer workflow\n\nThe same basic pattern emerges many times in this book.
