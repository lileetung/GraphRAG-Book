At Google, engineers who encounter these tests\nhave found ways to work around slowdowns, with some going as far as to\nskip the tests entirely when submitting changes. Obviously, this is a risky\npractice and should be discouraged, but if a test suite is causing more harm\nthan good, eventually engineers will find a way to get their job done, tests or\nno tests.\n\n\fThe secret to living with a large test suite is to treat it with respect.\nIncentivize engineers to care about their tests; reward them as much for\nhaving rock-solid tests as you would for having a great feature launch. Set\nappropriate performance goals and refactor slow or marginal tests. Basically,\ntreat your tests like production code. When simple changes begin taking\nnontrivial time, spend effort making your tests less brittle.\nIn addition to developing the proper culture, invest in your testing\ninfrastructure by developing linters, documentation, or other assistance that\nmakes it more difficult to write bad tests. Reduce the number of frameworks\nand tools you need to support to increase the efficiency of the time you invest\nto improve things.8 If you don\u2019t invest in making it easy to manage your\ntests, eventually engineers will decide it isn\u2019t worth having them at all.\n\nHistory of Testing at Google\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed how Google approaches testing, it might be\nenlightening\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
