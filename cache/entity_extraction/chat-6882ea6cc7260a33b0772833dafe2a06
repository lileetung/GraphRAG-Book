Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

This might be the case if the author wants to have their\nchange reviewed by a software engineer and the user-experience person\nresponsible for the feature, or the SRE carrying the pager for the service.\nCritique helps define who is expected to look at the change next by managing\nan attention set for each change.\nThe attention set comprises the set of people on which a change is currently\nblocked. When a reviewer or author is in the attention set, they are expected\nto respond in a timely manner. Critique tries to be smart about updating the\nattention set when a user publishes their comments, but users can also\nmanage the attention set themselves. Its usefulness increases even more when\nthere are more reviewers in the change. The attention set is surfaced in\nCritique by rendering the relevant usernames in bold.\nAfter we implemented this feature, our users had a difficult time imagining\nthe previous state. The prevailing opinion is how did we get along without\nthis? The alternative before we implemented this feature was chatting\nbetween reviewers and authors to understand who was dealing with a change.\nThis feature also emphasizes the turn-based nature of code review; it is\nalways at least one person\u2019s turn to take action.\nDASHBOARD AND SEARCH SYSTEM\nCritique\u2019s landing page is the user\u2019s dashboard page, as depicted\nin Figure 19-8.
