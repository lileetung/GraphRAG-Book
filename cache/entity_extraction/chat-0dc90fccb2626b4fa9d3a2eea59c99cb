A good build system will generally try to optimize\nfor two important properties:\nFast\nA developer should be able to type a single command to run the build\nand get back the resulting binary, often in as little as a few seconds.\nCorrect\nEvery time any developer runs a build on any machine, they should get\nthe same result (assuming that the source files and other inputs are\nthe same).\nMany older build systems attempt to make trade-offs between speed and\ncorrectness by taking shortcuts that can lead to inconsistent builds. Bazel\u2019s\nmain objective is to avoid having to choose between speed and correctness,\nproviding a build system structured to ensure that it\u2019s always possible to\nbuild code efficiently and consistently.\n\n\fBuild systems aren\u2019t just for humans; they also allow machines to create\nbuilds automatically, whether for testing or for releases to production.
