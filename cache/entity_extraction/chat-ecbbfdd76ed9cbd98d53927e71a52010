Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Sometimes this\nis feasible, but often it\u2019s a much trickier problem than it appears. For\nexample, in languages like C++ that allow files to be included directly by\nother files, it\u2019s impossible to determine the entire set of files that must be\n\n\fwatched for changes without parsing the input sources. Engineers will often\nend up taking shortcuts, and these shortcuts can lead to rare and frustrating\nproblems where a task result is reused even when it shouldn\u2019t be. When this\nhappens frequently, engineers get into the habit of running clean before every\nbuild to get a fresh state, completely defeating the purpose of having an\nincremental build in the first place.
