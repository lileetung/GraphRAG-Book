The slower a test suite, the less frequently it will be run, and\nthe less benefit it provides. We use a number of techniques to speed up our\ntest suite, including parallelizing execution and using faster hardware.\nHowever, these kinds of tricks are eventually swamped by a large number of\nindividually slow test cases.\nTests can become slow for many reasons like booting significant portions of\na system, firing up an emulator before execution, processing large datasets, or\nwaiting for disparate systems to synchronize. Tests often start fast enough but\nslow down as the system grow. For example, maybe you have an integration\ntest exercising a single dependency that takes five seconds to respond, but\nover the years you grow to depend on a dozen services and now the same\ntests take five minutes.\nTests can also become slow due to unnecessary speed limits introduced by\nfunctions like sleep() and setTimeout().
