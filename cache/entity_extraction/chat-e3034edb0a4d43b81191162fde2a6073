Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

For example, it\u2019s\npossible to find an answer to a problem in a mailing list thread, but the\nprimary goal of the original question on the thread was to seek answers, and\nonly secondarily to document the discussion for others.\nIn this section, we focus on spotting opportunities for contributing to and\ncreating formal documentation, from small things like fixing a typo to larger\nefforts such as documenting tribal knowledge.\n\nNOTE\nFor a more comprehensive discussion of documentation, see Chapter 10.\nUPDATING DOCUMENTATION\nThe first time you learn something is the best time to see ways that the\nexisting documentation and training materials can be improved. By the time\nyou\u2019ve absorbed and understood a new process or system, you might have\nforgotten what was difficult or what simple steps were missing from the\n\u201cGetting Started\u201d documentation.
