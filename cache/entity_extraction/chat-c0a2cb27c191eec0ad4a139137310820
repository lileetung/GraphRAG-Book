It is often a\nquick and easy way to replace a real implementation in a test. For example,\nthe code in Example 13-12 uses stubbing to simulate the response from a\ncredit card server:\nExample 13-12. Using stubbing to simulate responses\n\n@Test public void getTransactionCount() {\ntransactionCounter = new\nTransactionCounter(mockCreditCardServer);\n// Use stubbing to return three transactions.\nwhen(mockCreditCardServer.getTransactions()).thenReturn(\nnewList(TRANSACTION_1, TRANSACTION_2, TRANSACTION_3));\nassertThat(transactionCounter.getTransactionCount()).isEqualTo(3\n);\n}\n\nThe Dangers of Overusing Stubbing\nBecause stubbing is so easy to apply in tests, it can be tempting to use this\ntechnique anytime it\u2019s not trivial to use a real implementation. However,\noveruse of stubbing can result in major losses in productivity for engineers\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
