For example, although\neverybody appreciates having freshly paved roads, if the public works\ndepartment decided to close down every road for paving simultaneously,\nnobody would go anywhere. By focusing their efforts, paving crews can get\nspecific jobs done faster while also allowing other traffic to make progress.\nLikewise, it\u2019s important to choose deprecation projects with care and then\ncommit to following through on finishing them.\n\nWhy Is Deprecation So Hard?\nWe\u2019ve mentioned Hyrum\u2019s Law elsewhere in this book, but it\u2019s worth\nrepeating its applicability here: the more users of a system, the higher the\nprobability that users are using it in unexpected and unforeseen ways, and the\nharder it will be to deprecate and remove such a system. Their usage just\n\u201chappens to work\u201d instead of being \u201cguaranteed to work.\u201d In this context,\nremoving a system can be thought of as the ultimate change: we aren\u2019t just\nchanging behavior, we are removing that behavior completely! This kind of\nradical alteration will shake loose a number of unexpected dependents.\n\n\fTo further complicate matters, deprecation usually isn\u2019t an option until a\nnewer system is available which provides the same (or better!) functionality.\nThe new system might be better, but it is also different: after all, if it were\nexactly the same as the obsolete system, it\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
