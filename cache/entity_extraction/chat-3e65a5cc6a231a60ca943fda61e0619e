When those unit tests need doubles and when the\ndoubles used are mocks, it is the engineer writing the unit test defining the\nmock and its intended behavior. But that engineer usually did not write the\nthing being mocked and can be misinformed about its actual behavior. The\nrelationship between the unit under test and a given peer is a behavioral\ncontract, and if the engineer is mistaken about the actual behavior, the\nunderstanding of the contract is invalid.\nMoreover, mocks become stale. If this mock-based unit test is not visible to\nthe author of the real implementation and the real implementation changes,\nthere is no signal that the test (and the code being tested) should be updated\nto keep up with the changes.\nNote that, as mentioned in Chapter 13, if teams provide fakes for their own\nservices, this concern is mostly alleviated.\nCONFIGURATION ISSUES\nUnit tests cover code within a given binary. But that binary is typically not\ncompletely self-sufficient in terms of how it is executed. Usually a binary has\nsome kind of deployment configuration or starter script. Additionally, real\nend-user-serving production instances have their own configuration files or\nconfiguration databases.\n\n\fIf there are issues with these files or the compatibility between the state\ndefined by these stores and the binary in question, these can lead to major\nuser issues.
