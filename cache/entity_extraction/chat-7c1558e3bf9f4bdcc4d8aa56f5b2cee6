A\nreviewer shouldn\u2019t propose alternatives because of personal opinion.\nReviewers can propose alternatives, but only if they improve comprehension\n(by being less complex, for example) or functionality (by being more\nefficient, for example). In general, engineers are encouraged to approve\nchanges that improve the codebase rather than wait for consensus on a more\n\u201cperfect\u201d solution. This focus tends to speed up code reviews.\nAs tooling becomes stronger, many correctness checks are performed\nautomatically through techniques such as static analysis and automated\ntesting (though tooling might never completely obviate the value for humanbased inspection of code). (See Chapter 20 for more information). Though\nthis tooling has its limits, it has definitely lessoned the need to rely on\nhuman-based code reviews for checking code correctness.\nThat said, checking for defects during the initial code review process is still\nan integral part of a general \u201cshift left\u201d strategy, aiming to discover and\nresolve issues at the earliest possible time, so that they don\u2019t require escalated\ncosts and resources further down in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
