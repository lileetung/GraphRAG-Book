Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Programming assignments and exercises\ntend to be write-once, with little to no refactoring and certainly no long-term\nmaintenance. These programs are often not rebuilt or executed ever again\nafter their initial production. This isn\u2019t surprising in a pedagogical setting.\nPerhaps in secondary or post-secondary education we may find a team\nproject course or hands-on thesis. If so, such projects are likely the only time\nstudent code is likely to live longer than a month or so. Those developers\nmight need to refactor some code, perhaps as a response to changing\n\n\frequirements, but it is unlikely they are being asked to deal with broader\nchanges to their environment.\nWe also find developers of short-lived code in common industry settings.\nMobile apps often have a fairly short life span, 6 and for better or worse, full\nrewrites are relatively common. Engineers at an early-stage startup might\nrightly choose to focus on immediate goals over long-term investments: the\ncompany might not live long enough to reap the benefits of an infrastructure\ninvestment that pays off slowly. A serial startup developer could very\nreasonably have 10 years of development experience, and little or no\nexperience maintaining any piece of software\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
