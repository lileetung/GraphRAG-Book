It has enabled us\nto build larger systems with larger teams, faster than we ever thought\npossible. It has helped us keep up with the increasing pace of technological\nchange. Over the past 15 years, we have successfully transformed our\nengineering culture to elevate testing into a cultural norm. Despite the\ncompany growing by a factor of almost 100 times since the journey began,\nour commitment to quality and testing is stronger today than it has ever been.\nThis chapter has been written to help orient you to how Google thinks about\ntesting. In the next few chapters we are going to dive even deeper into some\nkey topics that have helped shape our understanding of what it means to write\ngood, stable, and reliable tests. We will discuss the what, why, and how of\nunit tests, the most common kind of test at Google. We will wade into the\ndebate on how to effectively use test doubles in tests through techniques such\nas faking, stubbing, and interaction testing. Finally, we will discuss the\nchallenges with testing larger and more complex systems, like many of those\nwe have at Google.\nAt the conclusion of these three chapters you should have a much deeper and\nclearer picture of the testing strategies we use and, more important, why we\nuse them.\n\nTL;DRs\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
