A compute service that\nallows the engineer to just run the analysis on a distributed environment in\nseveral minutes (utilizing a few hundred cores) means the difference between\nhaving the analysis now and having it tomorrow. For tasks that require\niteration\u2014for example, if I will need to refine the query after seeing the\nresults\u2014the difference may be between having it done in a day and not\nhaving it done at all.\nOne concern that arises at times with this approach is that allowing engineers\nto just run one-off jobs on the distributed environment risks them wasting\nresources. This is, of course, a trade-off, but one that should be made\nconsciously. It\u2019s very unlikely that the cost of processing that the engineer\nruns is going to be more expensive than the engineer\u2019s time spent on writing\nthe processing code. The exact trade-off values differ depending on an\n\n\forganization\u2019s compute environment and how much it pays its engineers, but\nit\u2019s unlikely that a thousand core hours costs anything close to a day of\nengineering work.
