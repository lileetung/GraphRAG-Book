Additionally, as Hyrum\u2019s Law states, the actual public API is\nnot the declared one but all user-visible aspects of a product. Given those two\nproperties, it is no surprise that A/B diff tests are possibly the most common\nform of larger testing at Google. This approach conceptually dates back to\n\n\f1998. At Google, we have been running tests based on this model since 2001\nfor most of our products, starting with Ads, Search, and Maps.\nA/B diff tests operate by sending traffic to a public API and comparing the\nresponses between old and new versions (especially during migrations). Any\ndeviations in behavior must be reconciled as either anticipated or\nunanticipated (regressions).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
