A remote execution system\n\nThe build tool running on each user\u2019s machine (where users are either human\nengineers or automated build systems) sends requests to a central build\nmaster. The build master breaks the requests into their component actions,\nand schedules the execution of those actions over a scalable pool of workers.\nEach worker performs the actions asked of it with the inputs specified by the\n\n\fuser and writes out the resulting artifacts. These artifacts are shared across the\nother machines executing actions that require them until the final output can\nbe produced and sent to the user.\nThe trickiest part of implementing such a system is managing the\ncommunication between the workers, the master, and the user\u2019s local\nmachine. Workers might depend on intermediate artifacts produced by other\nworkers, and the final output needs to be sent back to the user\u2019s local\nmachine. To do this, we can build on top of the distributed cache described\npreviously by having each worker write its results to and read its\ndependencies from the cache. The master blocks workers from proceeding\nuntil everything they depend on has finished, in which case they\u2019ll be able to\nread their inputs from the cache. The final product is also cached, allowing\nthe local machine to download it. Note that we also need a separate means of\nexporting the local changes in the user\u2019s source tree so that workers can\napply those changes before building.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
