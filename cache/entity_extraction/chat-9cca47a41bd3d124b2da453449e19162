Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

In the prereview\nstep, making it easier for change authors to polish a change before sending it\nout for review helps reduce the time taken by the reviewers to inspect the\nchange. Critique displays change diffs with knobs to ignore whitespace\nchanges and highlight move-only changes. Critique also surfaces the results\nfrom builds, tests, and static analyzers including style checks (as discussed\nin Chapter 9).\nShowing an author the diff of a change gives them the opportunity to wear a\ndifferent hat: that of a code reviewer. Critique lets a change author see the\ndiff of their changes as their reviewer will, and also see the automatic\nanalysis results. Critique also supports making lightweight modifications to\nthe change from within the review tool and suggests appropriate reviewers.\nWhen sending out the request, the author can also include preliminary\ncomments on the change, providing the opportunity to ask reviewers directly\nabout any open questions. Giving authors the chance to see a change just as\ntheir reviewers do prevents misunderstanding.\nTo provide further context for the reviewers, the author can also link the\nchange to a specific bug. Critique uses an autocomplete service to show\nrelevant bugs, prioritizing bugs that are assigned to the author.\n\nDiffing\nThe core of the code review process is understanding the code change itself.\nLarger changes are typically more difficult to understand than smaller ones.\nOptimizing the diff of a change is thus a core requirement for a good code\nreview tool\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
