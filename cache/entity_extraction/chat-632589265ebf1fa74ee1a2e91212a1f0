Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

If there are only a\nhandful of users, it might not be worth their time, whereas if there are\nhundreds of users, it can result in an obvious productivity improvement.\nTo reduce the number of fakes that need to be maintained, a fake should\ntypically be created only at the root of the code that isn\u2019t feasible for use in\ntests. For example, if a database can\u2019t be used in tests, a fake should exist for\nthe database API itself rather than for each class that calls the database API.\nMaintaining a fake can be burdensome if its implementation needs to be\nduplicated across programming languages, such as for a service that has\nclient libraries that allow the service to be invoked from different languages.\nOne solution for this case is to create a single fake service implementation\nand have tests configure the client libraries to send requests to this fake\nservice. This approach is more heavyweight compared to having the fake\n\n\fwritten entirely in memory because it requires the test to communicate across\nprocesses. However, it can be a reasonable trade-off to make, as long as the\ntests can still execute quickly.\n\nThe Fidelity of Fakes\nPerhaps the most important concept surrounding the creation of fakes\nis fidelity; in other words, how\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
