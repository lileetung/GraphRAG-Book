Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

A common vocabulary allows engineers to\nconcentrate on what their code needs to say rather than how they\u2019re saying it.\nBy shaping this vocabulary, engineers will tend to do the \u201cgood\u201d things by\ndefault, even subconsciously. Rules thus give us broad leverage to nudge\ncommon development patterns in desired directions.\n\nCreating the Rules\n\n\fWhen defining a set of rules, the key question is not, \u201cWhat rules should we\nhave?\u201d The question to ask is, \u201cWhat goal are we trying to advance?\u201d When\nwe focus on the goal that the rules will be serving, identifying which rules\nsupport this goal makes it easier to distill the set of useful rules. At Google,\nwhere the style guide serves as law for coding practices, we do not ask,\n\u201cWhat goes into the style guide?\u201d but rather, \u201cWhy does something go into\nthe style guide?\u201d What does our organization gain by having a set of rules to\nregulate writing code?\n\nGuiding Principles\nLet\u2019s put things in context: Google\u2019s engineering organization is composed\nof more than 30,000 engineers.
