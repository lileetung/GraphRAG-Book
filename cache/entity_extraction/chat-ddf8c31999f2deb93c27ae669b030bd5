Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Get a notepad or other way to take notes, and write down\neverything you need to do along the way, assuming no domain knowledge or\nspecial setup constraints; after you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll likely know what mistakes\nyou made during the process\u2014and why\u2014and can then edit down your steps\nto get a more streamlined tutorial. Importantly, write everything you need to\ndo along the way; try not to assume any particular setup, permissions, or\ndomain knowledge. If you do need to assume some other setup, state that\nclearly in the beginning of the tutorial as a set of prerequisites.\nMost tutorials require you to perform a number of steps, in order. In those\ncases, number those steps explicitly. If the focus of the tutorial is on\nthe user (say, for external developer documentation), then number each\naction that a user needs to undertake. Don\u2019t number actions that the system\nmay take in response to such user actions. It is critical and important to\nnumber explicitly every step when doing this. Nothing is more annoying than\nan error on step 4 because you forget to tell someone to properly authorize\ntheir username, for example.\nEXAMPLE: A BAD TUTORIAL\n1.
