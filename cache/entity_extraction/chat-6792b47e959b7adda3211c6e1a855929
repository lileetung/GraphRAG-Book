Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Rather than fix\nit in place, the team decides to fork that infrastructure and tweak it to work\naround the bug\u2014without renaming the library or the symbols. It informs\nother teams near them, \u201cHey, we have an improved version of Abseil\nchecked in over here: check it out.\u201d A few other teams build libraries that\nthemselves rely on this new fork.\nAs we\u2019ll see in Chapter 21, we\u2019re now in a dangerous situation.
