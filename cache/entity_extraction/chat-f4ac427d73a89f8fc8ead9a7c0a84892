Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

(And as long as you get a stake in\nthe ground, you can improve this document over time.)\n\nTypes of Audiences\nWe\u2019ve pointed out that you should write at the skill level and domain\nknowledge appropriate for your audience. But who precisely is your\naudience? Chances are, you have multiple audiences based on one or more of\nthe following criteria:\n\n\nExperience level (expert programmers, or junior engineers who might\nnot even be familiar\u2014gulp!\u2014with the language.)\n\n\n\nDomain knowledge (team members, or other engineers in your\norganization who are familiar only with API endpoints).\n\n\n\nPurpose (end users who might need your API to do a specific task and\nneed to find that information quickly, or software gurus who are\nresponsible for the guts of a particularly hairy implementation that you\nhope no one else needs to maintain).\n\nIn some cases, different audiences require different writing styles, but in most\ncases, the trick is to write in a way that applies as broadly to your different\naudience groups as possible. Often, you will need to explain a complex topic\nto both an expert and a novice. Writing for the expert with domain\nknowledge may allow you to cut corners, but you\u2019ll confuse the novice;\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
