Identify all entities.

Note\nthat in many cases even if a particular calculation has to take a long time, it\ncan be split into smaller time windows by periodic checkpointing of state to\npersistent storage.\n\nConnecting to a Service\nAs mentioned earlier, if anything in the system has the name of the host on\nwhich your program runs hardcoded (or even provided as a configuration\nparameter at startup), your program replicas are not cattle. However, to\nconnect to your application, another application does need to get your address\nfrom somewhere. Where?\nThe answer is to have an extra layer of indirection; that is, other applications\nrefer to your application by some identifier which is durable across restarts of\nthe specific \u201cbackend\u201d instances. That identifier can be resolved by another\nsystem that the scheduler writes to when it places your application on a\nparticular machine. Now, to avoid distributed storage lookups on the critical\npath of making a request to your application, clients will likely look up the\naddress that your app can be found on, and set up a connection, at startup\ntime, and monitor it in the background. This is generally called service\ndiscovery, and many compute offerings have built-in or modular solutions.\nMost such solutions also include some form of load balancing, which reduces\ncoupling to specific backends even more.\nA\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
