The\nbehavior of the unique_ptr was unfamiliar to most engineers and the related move\nsemantics that the language introduced were very new and, to most engineers, very\nconfusing. Preventing the introduction of std::unique_ptr in the codebase seemed the\nsafer choice. We updated our tooling to catch references to the disallowed type and\nkept our existing guidance recommending other types of existing smart pointers.\nTime passed. Engineers had a chance to adjust to the implications of move semantics\nand we became increasingly convinced that using std::unique_ptr was directly in line\nwith the goals of our style guidance. The information regarding object ownership that\na std::unique_ptr facilitates at a function call site makes it far easier for a reader to\nunderstand that code. The added complexity of introducing this new type, and the\nnovel move semantics that come with it, was still a strong concern, but the significant\nimprovement in the long-term overall state of the codebase made the adoption\nof std::unique_ptr a worthwhile trade-off.\n\n\fBUILDING IN CONSISTENCY\nOur style guides also contain rules that cover a lot of the smaller stuff. For\nthese rules, we make and document a decision primarily to make and\ndocument\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
