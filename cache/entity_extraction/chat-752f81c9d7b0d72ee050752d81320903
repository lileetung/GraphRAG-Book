For\nthat reason, doing a selective Continuous Deployment, through experiments\nor feature flags, is a common strategy.7\nAs an RC progresses through environments, its artifacts (e.g., binaries,\ncontainers) ideally should not be recompiled or rebuilt. Using containers such\nas Docker helps enforce consistency of an RC between environments, from\nlocal development onward. Similarly, using orchestration tools like\nKubernetes (or in our case, usually Borg), helps enforce consistency between\ndeployments. By enforcing consistency of our release and deployment\nbetween environments, we achieve higher-fidelity earlier testing and fewer\nsurprises in production.\n\n\fContinuous Testing\nLet\u2019s look at how CB and CD fit in as we apply Continuous Testing (CT) to a\ncode change throughout its lifetime, as shown Figure 23-2.\n\nFigure 23-2.
