Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Static Analysis\nWritten by Cailtin Sadowski\nEdited by Lisa Carey\nStatic analysis refers to programs analyzing source code to find potential\nissues such as bugs, antipatterns, and other potential issues that can be\ndiagnosed without executing the program. The \u201cstatic\u201d part specifically refers\nto analyzing the source code instead of a running program (referred to as\n\u201cdynamic\u201d analysis). Static analysis can find bugs in programs early, before\nthey are checked in as production code. For example, static analysis can\nidentify constant expressions that overflow, tests that are never run, or invalid\nformat strings in logging statements that would crash when\nexecuted.1 However, static analysis is useful for more than just finding bugs.\nThrough static analysis at Google, we codify best practices, help keep code\ncurrent to modern API versions, and prevent or reduce technical debt.\nExamples of these analyses include verifying that naming conventions are\nupheld, flag\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
