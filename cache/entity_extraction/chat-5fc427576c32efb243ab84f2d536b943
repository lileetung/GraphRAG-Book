Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

This might sound tedious, but keep in mind that\nthis expense is spread across all the readers of the documentation. As Blaise\nPascal once said, \u201cIf I had more time, I would have written you a shorter\nletter.\u201d By keeping a document short and clear, you will ensure that it will\nsatisfy both an expert and a novice.\nAnother important audience distinction is based on how a user encounters a\ndocument:\n\n\n\n\nSeekers are engineers who know what they want and want to know if\nwhat they are looking at fits the bill. A key pedagogical device for this\naudience is consistency. If you are writing reference documentation for\nthis group (within a code file, for example), you will want to have your\ncomments follow a similar format, for example, so that readers can\nquickly scan a reference and see whether they find what they are\nlooking for.\nStumblers might not know exactly what they want. They might have\nonly a vague idea of how to implement what they are working with.\nThe key for this audience is clarity. Provide overviews or introductions\n(at the top of a file, for example) that explain the purpose of the code\nthey are looking at. It\u2019s also useful to identify when a doc\nis not appropriate for an audience.
