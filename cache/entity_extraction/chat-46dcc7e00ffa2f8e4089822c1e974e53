Goals, Signals, and Metrics\n\nTaking Action and Tracking Results\nRecall our original goal in this chapter: we want to take action and improve\nproductivity. After performing research on a topic, the team at Google always\nprepares a list of recommendations for how we can continue to improve. We\nmight suggest new features to a tool, improving latency of a tool, improving\ndocumentation, removing obsolete processes, or even changing the incentive\nstructures for the engineers. Ideally, these recommendations are \u201ctooldriven\u201d: it does no good to tell engineers to change their process or way of\nthinking if the tools do not support them in doing so. We instead always\nassume that engineers will make the appropriate trade-offs if they have the\nproper data available and the suitable tools at their disposal.\nFor readability, our study showed that it was overall worthwhile: engineers\nwho had achieved readability were satisfied with the process and felt they\nlearned from it. Our logs showed that they also had their code reviewed faster\nand submitted it faster, even accounting for no longer needing as many\nreviewers. Our study also showed places for improvement with the process:\nengine\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
