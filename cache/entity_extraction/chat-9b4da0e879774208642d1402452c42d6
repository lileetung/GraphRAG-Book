Almost every release has multiple cherry-picked changes and\nrespins. There is also a 50-hour manual regression testing cycle run by a\nremote QA team on every release. When the operational cost of a release is\nthis high, a cycle begins to develop in which you wait to push out your\nrelease until you\u2019re able to test it a bit more. Meanwhile someone wants to\nadd just one more feature that\u2019s almost ready, and pretty soon you have\nyourself a release process that\u2019s laborious, error prone, and slow. Worst of\nall, the experts who did the release last time are burned out and have left the\nteam, and now nobody even knows how to troubleshoot those strange crashes\nthat happen when you try to release an update, leaving you panicky at the\nvery thought of pushing that button.\nIf your releases are costly and sometimes risky, the instinct is to slow down\nyour release cadence and increase your stability period. However, this only\nprovides short-term stability gains, and over time it slows velocity and\nfrustrates teams and users. The answer is to reduce cost, increase discipline,\nand make the risks more incremental, but it is critical to resist the obvious\noperational fixes and invest in long-term architectural changes. The obvious\noperational fixes to this problem lead to a few traditional approaches:\n\n\freverting\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
