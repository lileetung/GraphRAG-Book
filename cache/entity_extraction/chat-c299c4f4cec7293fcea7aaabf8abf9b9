Identify all entities.

In the worst case\nwe\u2019ll be subjected to difficult-to-understand runtime bugs stemming from\nlinking in two mismatched versions of the same library. The \u201cfork\u201d has\neffectively added a coloring/partitioning property to the codebase: the\ntransitive dependency set for any given target must include exactly one copy\nof this library. Any link added from the \u201coriginal flavor\u201d partition of the\ncodebase to the \u201cnew fork\u201d partition will likely break things. This means that\nin the end that something as simple as \u201cadding a new dependency\u201d becomes\nan operation that might require running all tests for the entire codebase, to\nensure that we haven\u2019t violated one of these partitioning requirements.
