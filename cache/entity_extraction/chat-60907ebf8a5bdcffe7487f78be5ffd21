Although this isn\u2019t an intrinsic design requirement, it is\nwhere the current state of the art happens to be.\nFinally, it\u2019s worth pointing out that automatic language formatters are a\ncrucial part of the LSC infrastructure. Because we work toward optimizing\nour code for readability, we want to make sure that any changes produced by\nautomated tooling are intelligible to both immediate reviewers and future\nreaders of the code. All of the LSC-generation tools run the automated\nformatter appropriate to the language being changed as a separate pass so that\nthe change-specific tooling does not need to concern itself with formatting\nspecifics. Applying automated formatting, such as google-javaformat or clang-format to our codebase means that automatically produced\nchanges will \u201cfit in\u201d with code written by a human, reducing future\ndevelopment friction. Without automated formatting, large-scale automated\nchanges would never have become the accepted status quo at Google.\n\nOperation RoseHub\nLSCs have become a large part of Google\u2019s internal culture, but they are\nstarting to have implications in the broader world.
