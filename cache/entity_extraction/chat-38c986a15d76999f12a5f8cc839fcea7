Almost every line of code for every product and\nservice we operate is all stored in one place. We have more than two billion\nlines of code in the repository today.\nGoogle\u2019s codebase experiences close to 25 million lines of change every\nweek. Roughly half of them are made by the tens of thousands of engineers\nworking in our monorepo, and the other half by our automated systems, in\nthe form of configuration updates, or large-scale changes (Chapter 22). Many\nof those changes are initiated from outside the immediate project. We don\u2019t\nplace many limitations on the ability of engineers to reuse code.\n\n\fThe openness of our codebase encourages a level of co-ownership that lets\neveryone take responsibility for the codebase. One benefit of such openness\nis the ability to directly fix bugs in a product or service you use (subject to\napproval, of course) instead of complaining about it. This also implies that\nmany people will make changes in a part of the codebase owned by someone\nelse.\nAnother thing that makes Google a little different is that almost no teams use\nrepository branching. All changes are committed to the repository head and\nare immediately visible for everyone to see. Furthermore, all software builds\nare performed using the last committed change that our testing infrastructure\nhas validated. When a product or service is built, almost every dependency\nrequired to run it is also built from source,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
