Enforcement enables us to scale our test suites and still make\ncertain guarantees about speed, resource utilization, and stability. The extent\nto which these definitions are enforced at Google varies by language. For\nexample, we run all Java tests using a custom security manager that will\ncause all tests tagged as small to fail if they attempt to do something\nprohibited, such as establish a network connection.\n\nTest Scope\nThough we at Google put a lot of emphasis on test size, another important\nproperty to consider is test scope. Test scope refers to how much code is\nbeing validated by a given test. Narrow-scoped tests (commonly called \u201cunit\ntests\u201d) are designed to validate the logic in a small, focused part of the\ncodebase, like an individual class or method. Medium-scoped tests\n(commonly called integration tests) are designed to verify interactions\nbetween a small number of components; for example, between a server and\nits database. Large-scoped tests (commonly referred to by names\nlike functional tests, end-to-end tests, or system tests) are designed to validate\nthe interaction of several distinct parts of the system, or emergent behaviors\nthat aren\u2019t expressed in a single class or method.\nIt\u2019s important to note that when we talk about unit tests as being narrowly\nscoped, we\u2019re referring to the code that is being validated, not the code that is\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
