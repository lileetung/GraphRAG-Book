Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2.

You should be\naiming for this experience however you can.\n\nThe Three Pillars of Social Interaction\nSo, if teamwork is the best route to producing great software, how does one\nbuild (or find) a great team?\nTo reach collaborative nirvana, you first need to learn and embrace what I\ncall the \u201cthree pillars\u201d of social skills. These three principles aren\u2019t just about\ngreasing the wheels of relationships; they\u2019re the foundation on which all\nhealthy interaction and collaboration are based:\nPillar 1: Humility\nYou are not the center of the universe (or your code!). You\u2019re neither\nomniscient nor infallible. You\u2019re open to self-improvement.\nPillar 2: Respect\nYou genuinely care about others you work with. You treat them kindly\nand appreciate their abilities and accomplishments.\nPillar 3: Trust\n\n\fYou believe others are competent and will do the right thing, and\nyou\u2019re OK with letting them drive when appropriate.5\nIf you perform a root-cause analysis on almost any social conflict, you can\nultimately trace it back to a lack of humility, respect, and/or trust. That might\nsound implausible at first, but give it a try. Think about some nasty or\nuncomfortable social situation currently in your life. At the basest level, is\neveryone being appropriately humble?
