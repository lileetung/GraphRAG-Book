As a software organization scales, it must respond and adequately\ndesign for its user base, which in the interconnected world of computing\ntoday involves everyone, locally and around the world.

And, if an engineering organization wants to\n\n\fscale, it cannot ignore underrepresented groups; not only do such engineers\nfrom these groups augment the organization itself, they provide unique and\nnecessary perspectives for the design and implementation of software that is\ntruly useful to the world at large.\n\nTL;DRs\n\n\nBias is the default.\n\n\n\nDiversity is necessary to design properly for a comprehensive user\nbase.\n\n\n\nInclusivity is critical not just to improving the hiring pipeline for\nunderrepresented\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
