Identify all entities.

These questions are very targeted and can be very precisely\nanswered with either search queries or by following semantic links, like\n\u201cjump to symbol definition.\u201d Such questions often arise during larger tasks\nlike refactorings/cleanups or when collaborating with other engineers on a\nproject. Therefore, it is essential that these small knowledge gaps are\naddressed efficiently.\nCode Search provides two ways of helping: ranking the results, and a rich\nquery language. Ranking addresses the common cases, and searches can be\nmade very specific (e.g., restricting code paths, excluding languages, only\nconsidering functions) to deal with rarer cases.\nThe UI makes it easy to share a Code Search result with colleagues. So, for\ncode reviews, you can simply include the link, for example, \u201cHave you\nconsidered using this specialized hash map: cool_hash.h?\u201d. This is also very\nuseful for documentation, in bug reports, and in post-mortems, and is the\ncanonical way of referring to code within Google. Even older versions of the\ncode can be referenced, so links can stay valid as the codebase evolves.\n\nWhat?\nRoughly one quarter of Code Searches are classic file browsing, to answer\nthe question of what a specific part of the codebase is doing. These kinds of\ntasks are usually more exploratory, rather than locating a specific result.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
