Identify all entities.

Throughout this chapter, we\ncall back to the formulation, \u201cHow do we manage code that comes from\noutside our organization (or that we don\u2019t perfectly control): how do we\nupdate it, how do we manage the things it depends upon over time?\u201d We\nneed to be clear that any good solution here avoids conflicting requirements\nof any form, including diamond dependency version conflicts, even in a\ndynamic ecosystem in which new dependencies or other requirements might\nbe added (at any point in the network). We also need to be aware of the\nimpact of time: all software has bugs, some of those will be security critical,\nand some fraction of our dependencies will therefore be critical to update\nover a long enough period of time.\nA stable dependency-management scheme must therefore be flexible with\ntime and scale: we can\u2019t assume indefinite stability of any particular node in\nthe dependency graph, nor can we assume that no new dependencies are\nadded (either in code we control or in code we depend upon). If a solution to\ndependency management prevents conflicting requirement problems among\nyour dependencies, it\u2019s a good solution. If it does so without assuming\nstability in dependency version or dependency fan-out, coordination or\nvisibility between organizations, or significant compute resources, it\u2019s a great\nsolution.\nWhen proposing solutions to dependency management, there are four\ncommon options\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
