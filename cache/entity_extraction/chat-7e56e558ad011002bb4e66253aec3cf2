Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

With the Code Search web UI, there is no setup\nrequired (e.g., project descriptions, build environment), so it\u2019s also very easy\nand fast to learn about code, wherever it occurs, which improves developer\n\n\fefficiency. There\u2019s also no danger of missing code dependencies; for\nexample, when updating an API, reducing merge and library versioning\nissues.\n\nSpecialization\nPerhaps surprisingly, one advantage of Code Search is that it is not an IDE.\nThis means that the user experience (UX) can be optimized for browsing and\nunderstanding code, rather than editing it, which is usually the bulk of an IDE\n(e.g., keyboard shortcuts, menus, mouse clicks, and even screen space). For\nexample, because there isn\u2019t an editor\u2019s text cursor, every mouse click on a\nsymbol can be made meaningful (e.g., show all usages or jump to definition),\nrather than as a way to move the cursor. This advantage is so large that it\u2019s\nextremely common for developers to have multiple Code Search tabs open at\nthe same time as their editor.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
