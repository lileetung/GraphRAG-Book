Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

However, canarying can\ncause problems, too, particularly around compatibility between deployments\nwhen multiple versions are deployed at once. This is sometimes known\nas version skew, a state of a distributed system in which it contains multiple\nincompatible versions of code, data, and/or configuration. Like many issues\nwe look at in this book, version skew is another example of a challenging\nproblem that can arise when trying to develop and manage software over\ntime.\nExperiments and feature flags are extremely powerful feedback loops. They\nreduce deployment risk by isolating changes within modular components that\ncan be dynamically toggled in production.
