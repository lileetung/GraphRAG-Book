Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

This is\nusually by identifying the offending change and determining whether it needs\nto be rolled back (the preferred solution) or can be fixed going forward (a\nriskier proposition).\nIn practice the trade-off of allowing changes to be committed before\nverifying all tests has really paid off; the average wait time to submit a\nchange is around 11 minutes, often run in the background. Coupled with the\ndiscipline of the Build Cop, we are able to efficiently detect and address\nbreakages detected by longer running tests with a minimal amount of\ndisruption.\n\n\fCULPRIT FINDING\nOne of the problems we face with large test suites at Google is finding the\nspecific change that broke a test. Conceptually, this should be really easy:\ngrab a change, run the tests, if any tests fail, mark the change as bad.\nUnfortunately, due to a prevalence of flakes and the occasional issues with\nthe testing infrastructure itself, having confidence that a failure is real isn\u2019t\neasy. To make matters more complicated, TAP must evaluate so many\nchanges a day (more than one a second) that it can no longer run every test on\nevery change. Instead, it falls back to batching related changes together,\nwhich reduces the total number of unique tests to be run.
