As Figure 141 illustrates, unit tests bundle a test and a small portion of code together as a\nrunnable unit, which ensures the code is tested but is very different from how\nproduction code runs. Production itself is, naturally, the environment of\nhighest fidelity in testing. There is also a spectrum of interim options. A key\nfor larger tests is to find the proper fit, because increasing fidelity also comes\nwith increasing costs and (in the case of production) increasing risk of\nfailure.\n\nFigure 14-1. Scale of increasing fidelity\n\nTests can also be measured in terms of how faithful the test content is to\nreality. Many hand-crafted large tests are dismissed by engineers if the test\ndata itself looks unrealistic. Test data copied from production is much more\nfaithful to reality (having been captured that way) but a big challenge is how\nto create realistic test traffic before launching the new code. This is\n\n\fparticularly a problem in artificial intelligence (AI), for which the \u201cseed\u201d data\noften suffers from intrinsic bias. And, because most data for unit tests is\nhandcrafted, it covers a narrow range of cases and tends to conform to the\nbiases of the author. The uncovered scenarios missed by the data represent a\nfidelity gap in the tests.\n\nCommon Gaps in Unit Tests\nLarger tests might also be necessary where smaller tests fail.
