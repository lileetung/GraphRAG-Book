Over time, we\u2019ve found that a good FAQ and a solid historic track\nrecord of improvements have generated widespread endorsement of LSCs\nthroughout Google.\n\nCodebase Insight\nTo do LSCs, we\u2019ve found it invaluable to be able to do large-scale analysis of\nour codebase, both on a textual level using traditional tools, as well as on a\nsemantic level. For example, Google\u2019s use of the semantic indexing\ntool Kythe provides a complete map of the links between parts of our\ncodebase, allowing us to ask questions such as \u201cWhere are the callers of this\nfunction?\u201d or \u201cWhich classes derive from this one?\u201d Kythe and similar tools\nalso provide programmatic access to their data so that they can be\nincorporated into refactoring tools. (For further examples,\nsee Chapter 17 and Chapter 20.)\nWe also use compiler-based indices to run abstract syntax tree-based analysis\nand transformations over our codebase. Tools such as ClangMR, JavacFlume,\nor Refaster, which can perform transformations in a highly parallelizable\nway, depend on these insights as part of their function. For smaller changes,\nauthors can use specialized, custom tools, perl or sed, regular expression\nmatching, or even a simple shell script.\n\n\fWhatever tool your organization uses for change creation, it\u2019s important that\nits human effort scale sublinearly with the codebase; in other words\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
