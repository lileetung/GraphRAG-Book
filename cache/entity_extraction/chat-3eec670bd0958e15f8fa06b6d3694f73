Theoretically, a\ncompiler upgrade should be cheap given how much effort languages take to\nbe backward compatible, but how cheap of an operation is it in practice? If\nyou\u2019ve never done such an upgrade before, how would you evaluate whether\nyour codebase is compatible with that change?\nIn our experience, language and compiler upgrades are subtle and difficult\ntasks even when they are broadly expected to be backward compatible. A\ncompiler upgrade will almost always result in minor changes to behavior:\nfixing miscompilations, tweaking optimizations, or potentially changing the\nresults of anything that was previously undefined. How would you evaluate\nthe correctness of your entire codebase against all of these potential\noutcomes?\nThe most storied compiler upgrade in Google\u2019s history took place all the way\nback in 2006. At that point, we had been operating for a few years and had\nseveral thousand engineers on staff. We hadn\u2019t updated compilers in about\nfive years. Most of our engineers had no experience with a compiler change.\nMost of our code had been exposed to only a single compiler version. It was\na difficult and painful task for a team of (mostly) volunteers, which\neventually became a matter of finding shortcuts and simplifications in order\nto work around upstream compiler and language changes that we didn\u2019t know\nhow to adopt.14 In the end, the 2006 compiler upgrade was extremely painful.\nMany Hyrum\u2019s Law problems,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
