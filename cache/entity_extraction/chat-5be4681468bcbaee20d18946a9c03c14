Some dependencies are more explicit than others about the\nexpected maintenance cost for merely using that dependency: how much\ncompatibility is assumed? How much evolution is assumed? How are\nchanges handled? For how long are releases supported?\nWe suggest that a dependency provider should be clearer about the answers\nto these questions. Consider the example set by large infrastructure projects\nwith millions of users and their compatibility promises.\nC++\nFor the C++ standard library, the model is one of nearly indefinite backward\ncompatibility. Binaries built against an older version of the standard library\nare expected to build and link with the newer standard: the standard provides\nnot only API compatibility, but ongoing backward compatibility for the\nbinary artifacts, known as ABI compatibility. The extent to which this has\nbeen upheld varies from platform to platform. For users of gcc on Linux, it\u2019s\nlikely that most code works fine over a range of roughly a decade. The\nstandard doesn\u2019t explicitly call out its commitment to ABI compatibility\u2014\nthere are no public-facing policy documents on that point. However, the\nstandard does publish Standing Document 8 (SD-8), which calls out a small\nset of types of change that the standard library can make between versions,\ndefining implicitly what type of changes to be prepared for. Java is similar:\nsource is compatible between language versions, and JAR files from older\nreleases will readily work with newer versions.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
