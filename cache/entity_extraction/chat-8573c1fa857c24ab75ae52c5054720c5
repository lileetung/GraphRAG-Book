This approach conceptually dates back to\n\n\f1998. At Google, we have been running tests based on this model since 2001\nfor most of our products, starting with Ads, Search, and Maps.\nA/B diff tests operate by sending traffic to a public API and comparing the\nresponses between old and new versions (especially during migrations). Any\ndeviations in behavior must be reconciled as either anticipated or\nunanticipated (regressions). In this case, the SUT is composed of two sets of\nreal binaries: one running at the candidate version and the other running at\nthe base version. A third binary sends traffic and compares the results.\nThere are other variants. We use A-A testing (comparing a system to itself) to\nidentify nondeterministic behavior, noise, and flakiness, and to help remove\nthose from A-B diffs. We also occasionally use A-B-C testing, comparing the\nlast production version, the baseline build, and a pending change, to make it\neasy at one glance to see not only the impact of an immediate change, but\nalso the accumulated impacts of what would be the next-to-release version.\nA/B diff tests are a cheap but automatable way to detect unanticipated side\neffects for any launched system.\nLIMITATIONS\nDiff testing does introduce a few challenges to solve:\nApproval\nSomeone must understand the results enough to know whether any\ndifferences are expected\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
