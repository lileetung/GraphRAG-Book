Identify all entities.

There are all sorts of dependencies:\nsometimes there\u2019s a dependency on a task (e.g., \u201cpush the documentation\nbefore I mark a release as complete\u201d), and sometimes there\u2019s a dependency\non an artifact (e.g., \u201cI need to have the latest version of the computer vision\n\n\flibrary to build my code\u201d). Sometimes, you have internal dependencies on\nanother part of your codebase, and sometimes you have external\ndependencies on code or data owned by another team (either in your\norganization or a third party). But in any case, the idea of \u201cI need that before\nI can have this\u201d is something that recurs repeatedly in the design of build\nsystems, and managing dependencies is perhaps the most fundamental job of\na build system.\n\nTask-Based Build Systems\nThe shell scripts we started developing in the previous section were an\nexample of a primitive task-based build system. In a task-based build system,\nthe fundamental unit of work is the task. Each task is a script of some sort\nthat can execute any sort of logic, and tasks specify other tasks as\ndependencies that must run before them.
