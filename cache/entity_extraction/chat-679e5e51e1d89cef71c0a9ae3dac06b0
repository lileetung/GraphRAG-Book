Critique is a\nnatural melting pot for a quick one-click/hover access or even embedded UI\nsupport to these systems, although we need to be careful not to sacrifice\nsimplicity. For example, from a change page in Critique, the author needs to\nclick only once to start editing the change further in Cider. There is support\nto navigate between cross-references using Kythe or view the mainline state\nof the code in Code Search Chapter 17. Critique links out to the release tool\nso that users can see whether a submitted change is in a specific release. For\nthese tools, Critique favors links rather than embedding so as not to distract\nfrom the core review experience. One exception here is test coverage: the\ninformation whether a line of code is covered by a test is shown by different\n\n\fbackground colors on the line gutter in the file\u2019s diff view (not all projects\nuse this coverage tool).\nNote that tight integration between Critique and a developer\u2019s workspace is\npossible because of the fact that workspaces are stored in a FUSE-based\nfilesystem, accessible beyond a particular developer\u2019s computer.
