If we can increase the productivity of\nindividual engineers in the organization, we can increase the scope of our\nbusiness without the commensurate increase in communication overhead.\nGoogle has had to grow quickly into new businesses, which has meant\nlearning how to make our engineers more productive. To do this, we needed\nto understand what makes them productive, identify inefficiencies in our\n\n\fengineering processes, and fix the identified problems. Then, we would\nrepeat the cycle as needed in a continuous improvement loop. By doing this,\nwe would be able to scale our engineering organization with the increased\ndemand on it.\nHowever, this improvement cycle also takes human resources. It would not\nbe worthwhile to improve the productivity of your engineering organization\nby the equivalent of 10 engineers per year if it took 50 engineers per year to\nunderstand and fix productivity blockers. Therefore, our goal is to not only\nimprove software engineering productivity, but to do so efficiently.\nAt Google, we addressed these trade-offs by creating a team of researchers\ndedicated to understanding engineering productivity.
