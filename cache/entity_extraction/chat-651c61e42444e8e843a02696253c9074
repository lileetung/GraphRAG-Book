By reducing the flexibility exposed to the programmer, the\nbuild system can know more about what is being done at every step of the\nbuild. It can use this knowledge to make the build far more efficient by\nparallelizing build processes and reusing their outputs. But this is really just\nthe first step, and these building blocks of parallelism and reuse will form the\nbasis for a distributed and highly scalable build system that will be discussed\nlater.\nOTHER NIFTY BAZEL TRICKS\nArtifact-based build systems fundamentally solve the problems with\nparallelism and reuse that are inherent in task-based build systems. But there\nare still a few problems that came up earlier that we haven\u2019t addressed. Bazel\nhas clever ways of solving each of these, and we should discuss them before\nmoving on.\nTools as dependencies\nOne problem we ran into earlier was that builds depended on the tools\ninstalled on our machine, and reproducing builds across systems could be\ndifficult due to different tool versions or locations. The problem becomes\neven more difficult when your project uses languages that require different\ntools based on which platform they\u2019re being built on or compiled for (e.g.,\nWindows versus Linux), and each of those platforms requires a slightly\ndifferent set of tools to do the same job.\nBazel solves\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
