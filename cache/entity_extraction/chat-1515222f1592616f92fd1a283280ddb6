Usually, this involves writing documents that cross API boundaries.\nProject Foo might clearly know what documentation project Foo needs, but it\nprobably has a less clear idea what Project Bar needs. A technical writer is\nbetter able to stand in as a person unfamiliar with the domain. In fact, it\u2019s one\nof their critical roles: to challenge the assumptions your team makes about\nthe utility of your project. It\u2019s one of the reasons why many, if not most,\nsoftware engineering technical writers tend to focus on this specific type of\nAPI documentation.\n\nConclusion\nGoogle has made good strides in addressing documentation quality over the\npast decade, but to be frank, documentation at Google is not yet a first-class\ncitizen. For comparison, engineers have gradually accepted that testing is\nnecessary for any code change, no matter how small. As well, testing tooling\nis robust and varied, and plugged into an engineering workflow at various\npoints. Documentation is not ingrained at nearly the same level.\nTo be fair, there\u2019s not necessarily the same need to address documentation as\nwith testing. Tests can be made atomic (unit tests) and can follow prescribed\nform and function. Documents, for the most part, cannot.
