Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

It\u2019s not the bonus that matters: it\u2019s the peer acknowledgement.\n\nEstablishing Canonical Sources of Information\nCanonical sources of information are centralized, company-wide corpuses of\ninformation that provide a way to standardize and propagate expert\nknowledge. They work best for information that is relevant to all engineers\nwithin the organization, which is otherwise prone to information islands. For\nexample, a guide to setting up a basic developer workflow should be made\ncanonical, whereas a guide for running a local Frobber instance is more\nrelevant just to the engineers working on Frobber.\nEstablishing canonical sources of information requires higher investment\nthan maintaining more localized information such as team documentation,\nbut it also has broader benefits. Providing centralized references for the entire\norganization makes broadly required information easier and more predictable\nto find, and counters problems with information fragmentation that can arise\nwhen multiple teams grappling with similar problems produce their own\u2014\noften conflicting\u2014guides.\nBecause canonical information is highly visible and intended to provide a\nshared understanding at the organizational level, it\u2019s important that the\ncontent is actively maintained and vetted by subject matter experts.
