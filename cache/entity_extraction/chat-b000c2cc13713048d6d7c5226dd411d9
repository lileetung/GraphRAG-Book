Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

It\u2019s the same with code:\nbeing consistent may feel constraining at times, but it means more engineers\nget more work done with less effort: 3\n\n\nWhen a codebase is internally consistent in its style and norms,\nengineers writing code and others reading it can focus on what\u2019s\ngetting done rather than how it is presented. To a large degree, this\nconsistency allows for expert chunking. 4 When we solve our problems\nwith the same interfaces and format the code in a consistent way, it\u2019s\neasier for experts to glance at some code, zero in on what\u2019s important,\nand understand what it\u2019s doing. It also makes it easier to modularize\ncode and spot duplication. For these reasons, we focus a lot of attention\non consistent naming conventions, consistent use of common patterns,\nand consistent formatting and structure. There are also many rules that\nput forth a decision on a seemingly small issue solely to guarantee that\nthings are done in only one way. For example, take the choice of the\nnumber of spaces to use for indentation or the limit set on line\nlength.5\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
