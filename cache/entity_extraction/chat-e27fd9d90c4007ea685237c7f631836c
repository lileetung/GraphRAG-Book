Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Although most of this book focuses\non various technical trade-offs in engineering systems, it turns out that tradeoffs also apply to human behaviors. As a leader, you need to make decisions\nabout what your teams should do each week. Sometimes the trade-offs are\nobvious (\u201cif we work on this project, it delays that other one\u2026\u201d); sometimes\nthe trade-offs have unforeseeable consequences that can come back to bite\nyou, as in the preceding story.\nAt the highest level, your job as a leader\u2014either of a single team or a larger\norganization\u2014is to guide people toward solving difficult, ambiguous\nproblems. By ambiguous, we mean that the problem has no obvious solution\nand might even be unsolvable. Either way, the problem needs to be explored,\nnavigated, and (hopefully) wrestled into a state in which it\u2019s under control. If\nwriting code is analogous to chopping down trees, your job as a leader is to\n\u201csee the forest through the trees\u201d and find a workable path through that\nforest, directing engineers toward the important trees. There are three main\nsteps to this process. First, you need to identify the blinders; next, you need\nto identify the trade-offs; and then you need to decide and iterate on a\nsolution.\n\nIdentify the Blinders\nWhen you first approach a problem, you\u2019ll often discover that a group of\npeople has already been wrestling with it for years.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
