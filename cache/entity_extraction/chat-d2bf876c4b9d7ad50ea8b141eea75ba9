Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

We aim for local\nreasoning, where the goal is clear understanding of what\u2019s happening at the\ncall site without needing to find and reference other code, including the\nfunction\u2019s implementation.\nMost style guide rules covering comments are also designed to support this\ngoal of in-place evidence for readers. Documentation comments (the block\ncomments prepended to a given file, class, or function) describe the design or\nintent of the code that follows. Implementation comments (the comments\ninterspersed throughout the code itself) justify or highlight non-obvious\nchoices, explain tricky bits, and underscore important parts of the code. We\nhave style guide rules covering both types of comments, requiring engineers\nto provide the explanations another engineer might be looking for when\nreading through the code.\nBE CONSISTENT\nOur view on consistency within our codebase is similar to the philosophy we\napply to our Google offices. With a large, distributed engineering population,\nteams are frequently split among offices, and Googlers often find themselves\ntraveling to other sites. Although each office maintains its unique personality,\nembracing local flavor and style, for anything necessary to get work done,\nthings are deliberately kept the same.
