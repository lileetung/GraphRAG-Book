These tools can be\ncategorized as discovery, migration, and backsliding prevention tooling.\nDISCOVERY\nDuring the early stages of a deprecation process, and in fact during the entire\nprocess, it is useful to know how and by whom an obsolete system is being\nused. Much of the initial work of deprecation is determining who is using the\nold system\u2014and in which unanticipated ways. Depending on the kinds of\nuse, this process may require revisiting the deprecation decision once new\ninformation is learned. We also use these tools throughout the deprecation\nprocess to understand how the effort is progressing.\nWithin Google, we use tools like Code Search (see Chapter 17) and Kythe\n(see Chapter 23) to statically determine which customers use a given library,\nand often to sample existing usage to see what sorts of behaviors customers\nare unexpectedly depending on. Because runtime dependencies generally\nrequire some static library or thin client use, this technique yields much of the\ninformation needed to start and run a deprecation process. Logging and\nruntime sampling in production help discover issues with dynamic\ndependencies.\nFinally, we treat our global test suite as an oracle to determine whether all\nreferences to an old symbol have been removed. As discussed in Chapter 11,\ntests are a mechanism of preventing unwanted behavioral changes to a\nsystem as the ecosystem evolves. Deprecation is a large part of that\nevolution, and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
