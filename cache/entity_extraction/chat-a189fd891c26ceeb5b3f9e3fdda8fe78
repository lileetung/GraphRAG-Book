Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The\n\n\fthesis of her book is that most people declutter their lives incorrectly: they\nspend time tossing the bottom 20% in the garbage, but the remaining 80%\nstill feels too cluttered. She argues that the true work of decluttering is about\nidentifying the top 20%, not the bottom 20%. If you can identify only the\ncritical things, you should then toss out the other 80%. It sounds extreme, but\nit\u2019s quite effective. It is greatly freeing to declutter so radically.\nIt turns out that you can also apply this philosophy to your inbox or task\nlist\u2014the barrage of balls being thrown at you. Divide your pile of balls into\nthree groups: the bottom 20% are probably neither urgent nor important and\nvery easy to delete or ignore. There\u2019s a middle 60%, which might contain\nsome bits of urgency or importance, but it\u2019s a mixed bag. At the top, there\u2019s\n20% of things that are absolutely, critically important.\nAnd so now, as you work through your tasks, do not try to tackle the top\n80%\u2014you\u2019ll still end up overwhelmed and mostly working on urgent-butnot-important tasks. Instead, mindfully identify the balls that strictly fall in\nthe top 20%\u2014critical things that only you can do\u2014and focus strictly on\nthem.
