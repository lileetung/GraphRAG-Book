Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Ensuring\nthat there is at least good documentation in addition to a primary and a\nsecondary owner for each area of responsibility helps future-proof your\nproject\u2019s success and increases your project\u2019s bus factor. Hopefully most\nengineers recognize that it is better to be one part of a successful project than\nthe critical part of a failed project.\nBeyond the bus factor, there\u2019s the issue of overall pace of progress. It\u2019s easy\nto forget that working alone is often a tough slog, much slower than people\nwant to admit. How much do you learn when working alone? How fast do\nyou move? Google and Stack Overflow are great sources of opinions and\ninformation, but they\u2019re no substitute for actual human experience. Working\nwith other people directly increases the collective wisdom behind the effort.\nWhen you become stuck on something absurd, how much time do you waste\npulling yourself out of the hole? Think about how different the experience\nwould be if you had a couple of peers to look over your shoulder and tell\nyou\u2014instantly\u2014how you goofed and how to get past the problem.
