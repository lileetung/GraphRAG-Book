Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The goal is to preemptively install safety fences around a\nfeature\u2019s potential pitfalls while we all go through the learning process. At\nthe same time, before everyone takes off running, limiting use gives us a\nchance to watch the usage patterns that develop and extract best practices\nfrom the examples we observe. For these new features, at the outset, we are\nsometimes not sure of the proper guidance to give. As adoption spreads,\nengineers wanting to use the new features in different ways discuss their\nexamples with the style guide owners, asking for allowances to permit\nadditional use cases beyond those covered by the initial restrictions.\nWatching the waiver requests that come in, we get a sense of how the feature\nis getting used and eventually collect enough examples to generalize good\npractice from bad. After we have that information, we can circle back to the\nrestrictive ruling and amend it to allow wider use.\nINTRODUCING STD::UNIQUE_PTR\nWhen C++11 introduced std::unique_ptr, a smart pointer type that expresses\nexclusive ownership of a dynamically allocated object and deletes the object when\nthe unique_ptr goes out of scope, our style guide initially disallowed usage. The\nbehavior of the unique_ptr was unfamiliar to most engineers and the related move\nsemantics that the language introduced were very new and, to most engineers, very\nconfusing.
