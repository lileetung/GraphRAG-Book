Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Some things, like culture,\nare important at every stage of growth, whereas others, like establishing\ncanonical sources of information, might be more beneficial for more mature\norganizations.\n\n\fCultivating a Knowledge-Sharing Culture\nOrganizational culture is the squishy human thing that many companies treat\nas an afterthought. But at Google, we believe that focusing on the culture and\nenvironment first,11 results in better outcomes than focusing on only the\noutput\u2014such as the code\u2014of that environment.\nMaking major organizational shifts is difficult, and countless books have\nbeen written on the topic. We don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers, but we\ncan share specific steps Google has taken to create a culture that promotes\nlearning.\nSee the book Work Rules!12 for a more in-depth examination of Google\u2019s\nculture.\nRESPECT\nThe bad behavior of just a few individuals can make an entire team or\ncommunity unwelcoming.13 In such an environment, novices learn to take\ntheir questions elsewhere, and potential new experts stop trying and don\u2019t\nhave room to grow. In the worst cases, the group reduces to its most toxic\nmembers. It can be difficult to recover from this state.\nKnowledge sharing can and should be done with kindness and respect.
