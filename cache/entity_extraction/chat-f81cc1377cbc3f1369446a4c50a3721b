In fact, an informal survey of the C++ style guide by some of our C++\nlibrarians in mid-2018 estimated that roughly 90% of its rules could be\nautomatically verified. Error-checking tools take a set of rules or patterns and\nverify that a given code sample fully complies. Automated verification\nremoves the burden of remembering all applicable rules from the code\nauthor. If an engineer only needs to look for violation warnings\u2014many of\nwhich come with suggested fixes\u2014surfaced during code review by an\nanalyzer that has been tightly integrated into the development workflow, we\n\n\fminimize the effort that it takes to comply with the rules. When we began\nusing tools to flag deprecated functions based on source tagging, surfacing\nboth the warning and the suggested fix in-place, the problem of having new\nusages of deprecated APIs disappeared almost overnight. Keeping the cost of\ncompliance down makes it more likely for engineers to happily follow\nthrough.\nWe use tools like Clang-Tidy (for C++) and Error Prone (for Java) to\nautomate the process of enforcing rules. See Chapter 20 for an in-depth\ndiscussion of our approach.\nThe tools we use are designed and tailored to support the rules that we define.\nMost tools in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
