Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

However, because they tend to\nbe more difficult for readers to understand than the more\nverbose if statements, we restrict their usage. We value \u201csimple to read\u201d over\n\u201csimple to write.\u201d We\u2019re making a trade-off here: it can cost more upfront\nwhen engineers must repeatedly type potentially longer, descriptive names\nfor variables and types. We choose to pay this cost for the readability it\nprovides for all future readers.\nAs part of this prioritization, we also require that engineers leave explicit\nevidence of intended behavior in their code. We want readers to clearly\nunderstand what the code is doing as they read it. For example, our Java,\nJavaScript, and C++ style guides mandate use of the override annotation or\nkeyword whenever a method overrides a superclass method. Without the\nexplicit in-place evidence of design, readers can likely figure out this intent,\nthough it would take a bit more digging on the part of each reader working\nthrough the code.\nEvidence of intended behavior becomes even more important when it might\nbe surprising. In C++, it is sometimes difficult to track the ownership of a\npointer just by reading a snippet of code. If a pointer is passed to a function,\nwithout being familiar with the behavior of the function, we can\u2019t be sure\nwhat to expect. Does the caller still own the pointer?
