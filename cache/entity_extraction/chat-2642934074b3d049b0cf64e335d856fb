The presence of failing tests can quickly begin to erode\nconfidence in the test suite. As mentioned previously, fixing a broken build is\nthe responsibility of the Build Cop. The most effective tool the Build Cop has\nis the rollback.\nRolling a change back is often the fastest and safest route to fix a build\nbecause it quickly restores the system to a known good state.13 In fact, TAP\nhas recently been upgraded to automatically roll back changes when it has\nhigh confidence that they are the culprit.\nFast rollbacks work hand in hand with a test suite to ensure continued\nproductivity. Tests give us confidence to change, rollbacks give us\nconfidence to undo. Without tests, rollbacks can\u2019t be done safely. Without\nrollbacks, broken tests can\u2019t be fixed quickly, thereby reducing confidence in\nthe system.\n\n\fRESOURCE CONSTRAINTS\nAlthough engineers can run tests locally, most test executions happen in a\ndistributed build-and-test system called Forge. Forge allows engineers to run\ntheir builds and tests in our datacenters, which maximizes parallelism. At our\nscale, the resources required to run all tests executed on-demand by\nengineers, and all tests being run as part of the CB process, are enormous.\nEven given the amount of compute resource we have, systems like Forge and\nTAP are resource constrained\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
