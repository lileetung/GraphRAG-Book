Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Your visible\nattitude about absolutely everything\u2014no matter how trivial\u2014is\nunconsciously noticed and spreads infectiously to your team.\nOne of the early managers at Google, Bill Coughran, a VP of engineering,\nhad truly mastered the ability to maintain calm at all times. No matter what\nblew up, no matter what crazy thing happened, no matter how big the\nfirestorm, Bill would never panic. Most of the time he\u2019d place one arm across\nhis chest, rest his chin in his hand, and ask questions about the problem,\nusually to a completely panicked engineer. This had the effect of calming\nthem and helping them to focus on solving the problem instead of running\naround like a chicken with its head cut off. Some of us used to joke that if\nsomeone came in and told Bill that 19 of the company\u2019s offices had been\nattacked by space aliens, Bill\u2019s response would be, \u201cAny idea why they\ndidn\u2019t make it an even 20?\u201d\nThis brings us to another Zen management trick: asking questions.
