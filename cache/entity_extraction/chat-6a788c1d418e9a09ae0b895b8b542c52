The author also defines the actions that will\nbe generated by that rule. Each action declares its inputs and outputs, runs a\nparticular executable or writes a particular string to a file, and can be\nconnected to other actions via its inputs and outputs. This means that actions\nare the lowest-level composable unit in the build system\u2014an action can do\nwhatever it wants so long as it uses only its declared inputs and outputs, and\nBazel will take care of scheduling actions and caching their results as\nappropriate.\nThe system isn\u2019t foolproof given that there\u2019s no way to stop an action\ndeveloper from doing something like introducing a nondeterministic process\nas part of their action. But this doesn\u2019t happen very often in practice, and\npushing the possibilities for abuse all the way down to the action level greatly\ndecreases opportunities for errors. Rules supporting many common languages\nand tools are widely available online, and most projects will never need to\ndefine their own rules. Even for those that do, rule definitions only need to be\ndefined in one central place\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
