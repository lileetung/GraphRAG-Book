This means that a machine running only serving\njobs will be underutilized. It\u2019s tempting to try to take advantage of that slack\nby overcommitting the machine, but that defeats the purpose of the slack in\nthe first place because if the spike/outage does happen, the resources we need\nwill not be available.\nHowever, this reasoning applies only to serving jobs! If we have a number of\nserving jobs on a machine and these jobs are requesting RAM and CPU that\nsum up to the total size of the machine, no more serving jobs can be put in\nthere, even if real utilization of resources is only 30% of capacity. But\nwe can (and, in Borg, will) put batch jobs in the spare 70%, with the policy\nthat if any of the serving jobs need the memory or CPU, we will reclaim it\nfrom the batch jobs (by freezing them in the case of CPU or killing in the\ncase of RAM). Because the batch jobs are interested in throughput (measured\nin aggregate across hundreds of workers, not for individual tasks) and their\nindividual replicas are cattle anyway, they will be more than happy to soak\nup this spare capacity of serving jobs.\nDepending on the shape of the workloads in a given pool of machines, this\nmeans that either all of the batch workload is effectively running on free\nresources (because we are paying for them in the slack of serving jobs\nanyway)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
