A VCS helps coordinate the activities of teams by allowing multiple\ndevelopers to work on the same set of files simultaneously. Early VCSs did\nthis by granting one person at a time the right to edit a file\u2014that style of\nlocking is enough to establish sequencing (an agreed upon \u201cwhich is newer,\u201d\nan important feature of VCS). More advanced systems ensure that changes to\n\n\fa collection of files submitted at once are treated as a single unit\n(atomicity when a logical change touches multiple files). Systems like CVS\n(a popular VCS from the 90s) that didn\u2019t have this atomicity for a commit\nwere subject to corruption and lost changes. Ensuring atomicity removes the\nchance of previous changes being overwritten unintentionally, but requires\ntracking which version was last synced to\u2014at commit time, the commit is\nrejected if any file in the commit has been modified at head since the last\ntime the local developer synced. Especially in such a change-tracking VCS, a\ndeveloper\u2019s working copy of the managed files will therefore need metadata\nof its own.
