That definition implies that such tests are multithreaded tests that\nusually test at the scope of a binary under test. However, these tests are\ncritical for ensuring that there is no degradation in performance between\nversions and that the system can handle expected spikes in traffic.\nAs the scale of the load test grows, the scope of the input data also grows,\nand it eventually becomes difficult to generate the scale of load required to\ntrigger bugs under load.
