Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Customers simply see such deprecation work as\nan unfunded mandate, requiring them to push aside their own priorities to do\nwork just to keep their services running. This feels much like the \u201crunning to\nstay in place\u201d phenomenon and creates friction between infrastructure\nmaintainers and their customers. It\u2019s for this reason that we strongly advocate\nthat compulsory deprecations are actively staffed by a specialized team\nthrough completion.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that even with the force of policy behind them,\ncompulsory deprecations can still face political hurdles. Imagine trying to\nenforce a compulsory deprecation effort when the last remaining user of the\nold system is a critical piece of infrastructure your entire organization\ndepends on. How willing would you be to break that infrastructure\u2014and\neverybody that depends on it transitively\u2014just for the sake of making an\narbitrary deadline? It is hard to believe the deprecation is really compulsory if\nthat team can veto its progress.\nGoogle\u2019s monolithic repository and dependency graph gives us tremendous\ninsight into how systems are used across our ecosystem. Even so, some teams\nmight not even know they have a dependency on an obsolete system, and it\ncan be difficult to discover these dependencies analytically. It\u2019s also possible\nto find them dynamically through tests of increasing frequency and duration\nduring which the old system is turned off temporarily.
