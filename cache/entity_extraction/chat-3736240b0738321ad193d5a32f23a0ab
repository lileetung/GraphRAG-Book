Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Asymmetrical trade-offs like these are good for the\norganization as a whole given that many people can benefit from the time\ninvestment of a few, but without good incentives, it can be challenging to\nencourage such behavior. We discuss some of these structural incentives in\nthe section \u201cIncentives and Recognition\u201d.\nHowever, a document author can often directly benefit from writing\ndocumentation. Suppose that team members always ask you for help\n\n\fdebugging certain kinds of production failures. Documenting your\nprocedures requires an upfront investment of time, but after that work is\ndone, you can save time in the future by pointing team members to the\ndocumentation and providing hands-on help only when needed.\nWriting documentation also helps your team and organization scale.
