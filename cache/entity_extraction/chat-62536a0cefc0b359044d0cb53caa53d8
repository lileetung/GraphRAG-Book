Identify all entities.

These open channels make it easier to learn from\nothers outside your immediate circle and avoid information islands and\nduplication. Google Groups are especially popular: Google has thousands of\ninternal groups with varying levels of formality. Some are dedicated to\ntroubleshooting; others, like the Code Health group, are more for discussion\nand guidance. Internal Google+ is also popular among Googlers as a source\n\n\fof informal information because people will post interesting technical\nbreakdowns or details about projects they are working on.\n\nReadability: Standardized Mentorship Through\nCode Review\nAt Google, \u201creadability\u201d refers to more than just code readability; it is a\nstandardized, Google-wide mentorship process for disseminating\nprogramming language best practices.
