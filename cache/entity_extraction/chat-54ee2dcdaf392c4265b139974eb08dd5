Complex features often have\nsubtle pitfalls not obvious at first glance. Using these features without\nthoroughly understanding their complexities makes it easy to misuse them\nand introduce bugs.

The reflective Python\nfunctions hasattr() and getattr() allow a user to access attributes of objects\nusing strings:\nif hasattr(my_object, \u2019foo\u2019):\nsome_var = getattr(my_object, \u2019foo\u2019)\n\nNow, with that example, everything might seem fine.
