This approach is more heavyweight compared to having the fake\n\n\fwritten entirely in memory because it requires the test to communicate across\nprocesses. However, it can be a reasonable trade-off to make, as long as the\ntests can still execute quickly.\n\nThe Fidelity of Fakes\nPerhaps the most important concept surrounding the creation of fakes\nis fidelity; in other words, how closely the behavior of a fake matches the\nbehavior of the real implementation. If the behavior of a fake doesn\u2019t match\nthe behavior of the real implementation, a test using that fake is not useful\u2014a\ntest might pass when the fake is used, but this same code path might not work\nproperly in the real implementation.\nPerfect fidelity is not always feasible. After all, the fake was necessary\nbecause the real implementation wasn\u2019t suitable in one way or another. For\nexample, a fake database would usually not have fidelity to a real database in\nterms of hard-drive storage, because the fake would store everything in\nmemory.\nPrimarily, however, a fake should maintain fidelity to the API contracts of\nthe real implementation. For any given input to an API, a fake should return\nthe same output and perform the same state changes of its corresponding real\nimplementation.
