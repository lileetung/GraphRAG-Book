But you don\u2019t\nneed a robust command of English2 to produce workable\ndocumentation. You just need to step outside yourself a bit and see\nthings from the audience\u2019s perspective.\n\n\n\nWriting documentation is often more difficult because of limited tools\nsupport or integration into the developer workflow.\n\n\n\nDocumentation is viewed as an extra burden\u2014something else to\nmaintain\u2014rather than something that will make maintenance of their\nexisting code easier.\n\n\fNot every engineering team needs a technical writer (and even if that were\nthe case, there aren\u2019t enough of them). This means that engineers will, by and\nlarge, write most of the documentation themselves. So, instead of forcing\nengineers to become technical writers, we should instead think about how to\nmake writing documentation easier for engineers. Deciding how much effort\nto devote to documentation is a decision your organization will need to make\nat some point.\nDocumentation benefits several different groups. Even to the writer,\ndocumentation provides the following benefits:\n\n\nIt helps formulate an API. Writing documentation is one of the surest\nways to figure out if your API makes sense. Often, the writing of the\ndocumentation itself leads engineers to reevaluate design decisions that\notherwise wouldn\u2019t be questioned. If you can\u2019t explain it and can\u2019t\ndefine it, you probably haven\u2019t designed it well enough.\n\n\n\nIt provides a road map for maintenance and a historical record.
