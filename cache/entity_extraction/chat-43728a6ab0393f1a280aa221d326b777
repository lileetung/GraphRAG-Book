Identify all entities.

If you don\u2019t\nmeasure this, you can\u2019t fix problems. We only deploy analysis tools with low\nfalse-positive rates (more on that in a minute). We also actively solicit and\nact on feedback from developers consuming static analysis results, in real\ntime. Nurturing this feedback loop between static analysis tool users and tool\ndevelopers creates a virtuous cycle that has built up user trust and improved\nour tools. User trust is extremely important for the success of static analysis\ntools.\nFor static analysis, a \u201cfalse negative\u201d is when a piece of code contains an\nissue that the analysis tool was designed to find, but the tool misses it. A\n\u201cfalse positive\u201d occurs when a tool incorrectly flags code as having the issue.\nResearch about static analysis tools traditionally focused on reducing false\nnegatives; in practice, low false-positive rates are often critical for developers\nto actually want to use a tool\u2014who wants to wade through hundreds of false\nreports in search of a few true ones? 4\nFurthermore, perception is a key aspect of the false positive rate.
