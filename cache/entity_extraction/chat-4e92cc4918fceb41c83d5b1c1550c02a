Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Google\u2019s CI system will run not only the tests immediately\nimpacted by a change, but also any tests that transitively depend on the\nchanged files.6 This means a change gets broad coverage, but we\u2019ve also\nobserved that the farther away in the dependency graph a test is from the\nimpacted files, the more unlikely a failure is to have been caused by the\nchange itself.\nSmall, independent changes are easier to validate, because each of them\naffects a smaller set of tests, but also because test failures are easier to\ndiagnose and fix. Finding the root cause of a test failure in a change of 25\nfiles is pretty straightforward; finding 1 in a 10,000-file change is like the\nproverbial needle in a haystack.\n\n\fThe trade-off in this decision is that smaller changes will cause the same tests\nto be run multiple times, particularly tests that depend on large parts of the\ncodebase. Because engineer time spent tracking down test failures is much\nmore expensive than the compute time required to run these extra tests,\nwe\u2019ve made the conscious decision that this is a trade-off we\u2019re willing to\nmake.
