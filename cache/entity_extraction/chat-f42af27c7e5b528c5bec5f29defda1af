Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

You are in control of how and when to react to the passage of time\nand necessity to change.\nOn the other hand, if every developer forks everything used in their software\nproject instead of reusing what exists, scalability suffers alongside\nsustainability. Reacting to a security issue in an underlying library is no\nlonger a matter of updating a single dependency and its users: it is now a\nmatter of identifying every vulnerable fork of that dependency and the users\nof those forks.\nAs with most software engineering decisions, there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all\nanswer to this situation.
