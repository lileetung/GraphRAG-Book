What Is Software\nEngineering?\nWritten by Titus Winters\nEdited by Tom Manshreck\nNothing is built on stone; All is built on sand, but we must build as if the sand\nwere stone.\nJorge Luis Borges\n\nWe see three critical differences between programming and software\nengineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play. On a software engineering\nproject, engineers need to be more concerned with the passage of time and\nthe eventual need for change. In a software engineering organization, we\nneed to be more concerned about scale and efficiency, both for the software\nwe produce as well as for the organization that is producing it. Finally, as\nsoftware engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with\nhigher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and\ngrowth.\nWithin Google we sometimes say, \u201cSoftware engineering is programming\nintegrated over time.\u201d Programming is certainly a significant part of software\nengineering: after all, programming is how you generate new software in the\nfirst place. If you accept this distinction, it also becomes clear that we might\nneed to delineate between programming tasks (development) and software\nengineering tasks\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
