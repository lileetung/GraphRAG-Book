We\u2019ve found that\nlanguage features such as type aliasing and forwarding functions are\ninvaluable for allowing existing users to continue to function while we\nintroduce new systems and migrate users to them non-atomically. For\nlanguages that lack these features, it is often difficult to migrate systems\nincrementally.12\nWe\u2019ve also found that statically typed languages are much easier to perform\nlarge automated changes in than dynamically typed languages. Compilerbased tools, along with strong static analysis provide a significant amount of\ninformation that we can use to build tools to effect LSCs, and reject invalid\ntransformations before they even get to the testing phase. The unfortunate\nresult of this is that languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript that are\ndynamically typed are extra difficult for maintainers. Language choice is, in\nmany respects, intimately tied to the question of code lifespan: languages that\ntend to be viewed as more focused on developer productivity tend to be more\ndifficult to maintain. Although this isn\u2019t an intrinsic design requirement, it is\nwhere the current state of the art happens to be.\nFinally, it\u2019s worth pointing out that automatic language formatters are a\ncrucial part of the LSC infrastructure. Because we work toward optimizing\nour code for readability, we want to make sure that any changes produced by\nautomated tooling are intelligible to both immediate reviewers and future\nread\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
