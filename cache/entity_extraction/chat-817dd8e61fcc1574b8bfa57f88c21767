Engineers at many companies can tell a similar\nstory about a painful upgrade. What is unusual is that we recognized after the\nfact that the task had been painful and began focusing on technology and\norganizational changes to overcome the scaling problems and turn scale to\nour advantage: automation (so that a single human can do more),\nconsolidation/consistency (so that low-level changes have a limited problem\nscope), and expertise (so that a few humans can do more).\nThe more frequently you change your infrastructure, the easier it becomes to\ndo so. We have found that most of the time, when code is updated as part of\nsomething like a compiler upgrade, it becomes less brittle and easier to\nupgrade in the future. In an ecosystem in which most code has gone through\nseveral upgrades, it stops depending on the nuances of the underlying\nimplementation; instead, the actual abstraction guaranteed by the language or\nOS. Regardless of what exactly you are upgrading, expect the first upgrade\nfor a codebase to be significantly more expensive than later upgrades, even\ncontrolling for other factors.\nThrough this and other experiences, we\u2019ve discovered many factors that\naffect the flexibility of a codebase:\nExpertise\nWe know how to do this; for some languages we\u2019ve now done\nhundreds of compiler upgrades, across many platforms.\nStability\nThere is less change between releases because we adopt releases\nmore regularly; for some languages, we\u2019re now deploying\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
