In this chapter, we\u2019ll discuss the unique responsibilities of an\nengineer when designing products for a broad base of users. Further, we\nevaluate how an organization, by embracing diversity, can design systems\nthat work for everyone, and avoid perpetuating harm against our users.\nAs new as the field of software engineering is, we\u2019re newer still at\nunderstanding the impact it has on underrepresented people and diverse\nsocieties. We did not write this chapter because we know all the answers. We\ndo not. In fact, understanding how to engineer products that empower and\nrespect all our users is still something Google is learning to do. We have had\nmany public failures in protecting our most vulnerable users, and so we are\nwriting this chapter because the path forward to more equitable products\nbegins with evaluating our own failures and encouraging growth.\nWe are also writing this chapter because the increasing imbalance of power\nbetween those who make development decisions that impact the world and\nthose who simply must accept and live with those decisions that sometimes\ndisadvantages already marginalized communities globally. It is important to\nshare and reflect on what we\u2019ve learned so far with the next generation of\nsoftware engineers. It is even more important that we help influence the next\ngeneration of engineers to be better than we are today.\nJust picking up this book means that you likely aspire to be an exceptional\nengineer\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
