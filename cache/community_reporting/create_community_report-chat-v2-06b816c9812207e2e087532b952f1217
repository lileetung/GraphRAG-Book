Initially, Code Search relied on Memory for data storage, which provided faster access but was limited by cost and capacity constraints. As the index size grew, the limitations of Memory became apparent, prompting the shift to Flash Storage. This transition allowed Code Search to manage larger datasets more effectively, although it introduced higher access latency compared to Memory. The relationship between Code Search and Flash Storage is crucial for understanding the evolution of data storage solutions in this context.

While Memory offers faster access speeds, it is more expensive, making it less viable for large-scale applications. Flash Storage, on the other hand, provides a more cost-effective solution for storing larger amounts of data, albeit with higher access latency. This comparison is essential for organizations looking to optimize their data storage strategies, as it highlights the trade-offs between performance and cost. The relationship between Flash Storage and Memory underscores the importance of selecting the appropriate storage technology based on specific use cases.

As data volumes increase, the performance of indexing systems can be severely affected by the choice of storage technology. The shift to Flash Storage was a strategic decision to ensure that Code Search could continue to operate efficiently despite the increasing demands on its data handling capabilities.
