It categorizes changes into three main types: breaking changes, strictly additive changes, and non-API-impacting changes. This system is particularly focused on ensuring backward compatibility and managing dependencies effectively within software applications, thereby helping to maintain compatibility among different components.\n\nSemantic Versioning employs a version-number-plus-constraints approach, which conveys meaning about the underlying changes associated with each release. It indicates the significance of changes through major, minor, and patch version numbers, allowing developers to assess the risk associated with adopting new versions. While SemVer provides a structured way to manage software changes and dependencies, it is acknowledged that it can serve as a lossy estimate of compatibility, reflecting the inherent limitations of versioning schemes.\n\nOverall, SemVer serves as a de facto standard in the software development community, providing a framework for understanding the implications of changes in software APIs and helping developers make informed decisions regarding dependency management.\",19\n151,\"\"\"HYRUM'S LAW\"\"\",\"\"\"Hyrum's Law\"\" is a principle in software engineering that asserts that with a sufficient number of users of an API, all observable behaviors of the system will be relied upon by someone, regardless of the promises made in the contract. This principle highlights the limitations of software engineering practices, emphasizing that perfect adherence to contracts or best practices cannot be assumed. It underscores the importance of implicit dependencies in code, particularly as software systems evolve.\n\nAs software develops, the dependencies and interactions within it can lead to unforeseen issues, especially when changes are made to the API surface. Hyrum's Law illustrates that as software evolves, the implicit dependencies that users have on it can result in unexpected behaviors, complicating updates and transitions. This is particularly relevant in containerized environments, where changes in software libraries can significantly affect the behavior of dependent software, thereby impacting reliability and maintenance.\n\nMoreover, the principle indicates that the more users a system has, the more likely they are to utilize it in unforeseen ways, complicating the deprecation of that system. Consequently, the behavior of a software system can change based on how it is used, making it challenging to predict necessary changes over time.

IMPACT is the scored importance of a community.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the IMPACT severity rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.\n\nReturn output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format:\n    {{\n        \"title\": <report_title>,\n        \"summary\": <executive_summary>,\n        \"rating\": <impact_severity_rating>,\n        \"rating_explanation\": <rating_explanation>,\n        \"findings\": [\n            {{\n                \"summary\":<insight_1_summary>,\n                \"explanation\": <insight_1_explanation>\n            }},\n            {{\n                \"summary\":<insight_2_summary>,\n                \"explanation\": <insight_2_explanation>\n            }}\n        ]\n    }}\n\n# Grounding Rules\n\nPoints supported by data should list their data references as follows:\n\n\"This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record ids); <dataset name> (record ids)].\"\n\nDo not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference.
