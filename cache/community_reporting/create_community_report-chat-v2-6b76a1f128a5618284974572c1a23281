It is widely used for building applications and requires a build system for efficient development. Java is recognized in Google's style guide, highlighting its significance in the development community. The language is known for its strong packaging conventions, which influence the organization of targets and BUILD files within a codebase.\n\nJava accommodates specific coding practices, such as managing typical line lengths in diff views and employing a standard practice called shading to handle internal dependencies within libraries. The Java programming team actively seeks assistance to evaluate and improve their software processes and outcomes. It allows classes to be defined as 'public' for accessibility within packages, which impacts unit testing approaches.\n\nReadability is a core principle of Java, necessitating explicit evidence of intended behavior in code. The language emphasizes source compatibility, enabling older JAR files to function with newer releases. Java employs specific commenting frameworks like Javadoc for generating reference documentation and includes annotations such as @deprecated to indicate deprecated symbols in the code. It is often referenced in search results related to coding functions and examples, and it provides mechanisms to manage dependencies and rename symbols to avoid conflicts in builds.\n\nJava requires a compiler to build code, often involving multiple dependencies and external third-party JAR files. It mandates specific readability standards and practices for code review, particularly within Google's engineering teams, where training is provided to ensure adherence to best practices. The language supports annotations like @DoNotMock to enhance static analysis and testing strategies, and it embeds reference documentation directly in its source code, similar to Python and Go.\n\nAt Google, Java is configured to avoid displaying compiler warnings as part of the company's coding policy, and specific testing protocols are enforced to maintain security and performance standards. It is also utilized for writing automated tests. As a traditional imperative programming language, Java specifies lists of statements to be executed sequentially.
