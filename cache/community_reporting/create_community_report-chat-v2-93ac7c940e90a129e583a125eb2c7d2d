This imbalance can complicate the testing process for engineers, making it difficult to catch failures that occur during integration. The reliance on end-to-end tests may lead to a false sense of security, as these tests do not always cover the interactions between different components of the software. Consequently, engineers may face increased challenges in ensuring the reliability of their software products.

This pattern can lead to potential failures, as the lack of comprehensive testing at different levels may result in undetected issues. Engineers encountering this pattern may struggle with the reliability of their testing strategies, as the absence of integration tests can mask problems that only arise when components interact.
