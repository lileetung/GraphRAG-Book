{"result": "The \"Quarterly Survey\" is an event designed to gather feedback from engineers about their satisfaction and experiences related to engineering velocity and readability processes. This survey specifically assesses engineers' perceptions of their own productivity, offering valuable insights into their engineering velocity. Additionally, it evaluates the quality of the engineers' code and the effects of the readability process on their work. Overall, the Quarterly Survey serves as a comprehensive tool for understanding and improving the engineering experience within the organization.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
