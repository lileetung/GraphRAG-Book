{"result": "Virtual Machines (VMs) are software emulations of physical computers that operate with an operating system and applications in the same manner as a physical machine. They serve as a classical solution for providing isolation in multitenant environments, enabling multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical machine. This capability allows for efficient resource utilization and enhanced flexibility in managing computing resources.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
