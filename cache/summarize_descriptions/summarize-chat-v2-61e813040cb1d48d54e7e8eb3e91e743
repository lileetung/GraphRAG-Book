{"result": "Flaky Tests are characterized as tests that may pass or fail inconsistently, leading to confusion and inefficiencies in the testing process. These unreliable tests can fail intermittently without any changes to the underlying code, which can mask real issues and diminish confidence in the overall testing strategy.
