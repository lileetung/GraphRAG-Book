{"result": "Google conducts DiRT exercises as part of its proactive approach to system management, aimed at discovering unknown dependencies between running systems. These exercises are integral to Google's strategy for managing system deprecations and ensuring that teams are adequately prepared for changes. Annually, Google organizes the DiRT event to rigorously test its disaster recovery capabilities and infrastructure resilience. Despite the high costs associated with creating outages for testing purposes, Google continues to run DiRT to conduct coordinated exercises that enhance its overall system reliability and preparedness.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
