{"result": "The entities \"BUILD files\" and \"MODULES\" are closely interconnected within the context of the Bazel build system. BUILD files serve a crucial role by defining the structure and dependencies of Modules, thereby guiding their interactions and visibility. Additionally, Modules utilize BUILD files to express their dependencies, which are essential for the overall build process in Bazel. This relationship highlights the importance of BUILD files in facilitating the proper functioning and organization of Modules within the build environment.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
