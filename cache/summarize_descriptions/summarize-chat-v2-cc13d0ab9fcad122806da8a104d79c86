{"result": "The CEO is a high-ranking executive in a company, recognized as the highest-ranking individual responsible for making major corporate decisions and managing overall operations and resources. This character values learning from mistakes and emphasizes the importance of retaining valuable executives despite failures. However, the CEO also imposes additional requirements on employees, such as dress codes, without providing corresponding compensation.
