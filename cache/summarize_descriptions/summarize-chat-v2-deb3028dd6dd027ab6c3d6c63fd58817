{"result": "The \"Style Guide\" is a comprehensive set of rules and guidelines for coding practices at Google, specifically tailored for C++. It serves as a framework that dictates how code should be written and structured, encompassing various aspects such as naming conventions for macros. Initially, the Style Guide disallowed the use of std::unique_ptr; however, it has since adapted to include this modern C++ feature, reflecting the guide's responsiveness to community feedback and the identification of evolving best practices. Overall, the Style Guide is designed to ensure consistency and quality in coding across the organization.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
