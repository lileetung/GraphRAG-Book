{"result": "The \"One Version Rule\" is a guideline in software development that underscores the significance of maintaining a single version of components. This approach is designed to prevent incompatibilities and facilitate efficient scaling within software systems. Additionally, the One Version Rule advocates for minimal long-lived branches, promoting the practice of developing in small increments directly against the trunk. This policy aims to streamline the development process and enhance collaboration among developers by ensuring that everyone is working with the same version of the software components.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
