{"result": "Brittle Tests are automated tests characterized by their excessive sensitivity to changes within the codebase. These tests often fail as a result of unrelated modifications, which can significantly hinder the development process. Specifically, Brittle Tests are known to fail due to changes in production code that are not directly related to the functionality being tested, leading to maintenance challenges for engineers. This sensitivity creates issues for engineers, as it complicates the testing process and can disrupt the overall workflow.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
