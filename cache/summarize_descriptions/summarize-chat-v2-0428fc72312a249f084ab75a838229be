{"result": "Nondeterminism refers to a condition in which the outcome of a test can vary even when the system being tested remains unchanged. This variability can lead to potential flakiness in tests, making it challenging to achieve consistent results. Additionally, nondeterminism can arise from external factors or dependencies that influence the system's output, further complicating the testing process.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
