{"result": "The Distributed Build System is a system developed by Google that is designed to manage software builds across multiple engineers. Its primary goal is to enhance build efficiency and reduce resource costs associated with local builds. By effectively managing dependencies, the system aims to prevent bloated dependencies that can arise if not properly handled. Ultimately, the Distributed Build System improves the speed and efficiency of software builds, leading to increased productivity for engineers.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
