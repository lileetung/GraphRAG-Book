{"result": "The \"C++ Style Guide\" is a comprehensive set of guidelines developed and maintained by a select group of senior engineers at Google, aimed at promoting best practices in C++ programming. This canonical document emphasizes the importance of optimizing code for the reader, ensuring clarity, readability, and maintaining code integrity and consistency throughout the codebase. \n\nThe guide outlines a series of rules and recommendations that focus on performance, consistency, and interoperability, adapting over time to meet the evolving needs of C++ programming. It explicitly disallows certain practices, such as the use of exceptions and the goto statement, which diverges from some external norms. Overall, the C++ Style Guide serves as a crucial resource for developers, fostering high-quality programming practices and ensuring a uniform approach to writing C++ code.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
