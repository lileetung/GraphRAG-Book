{"result": "\"Medium Tests\" are a category of software tests that are conducted on a single machine, specifically restricted to localhost for network calls. They are designed to span multiple processes and can make blocking calls, which allows for greater flexibility compared to smaller tests. However, this increased flexibility comes with an elevated risk of nondeterminism, meaning that the results of the tests may not be consistent across different runs. Overall, Medium Tests provide a balance between safety and flexibility, making them suitable for testing systems while imposing localhost restrictions to mitigate potential issues.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
