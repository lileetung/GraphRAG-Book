{"result": "The \"One-Version Rule\" is a comprehensive guideline and policy in software development that emphasizes the importance of managing dependency versions effectively. It advocates for manual and explicit versioning to avoid common pitfalls associated with dependency management. Specifically, the One-Version Rule is enforced by organizations like Google, mandating that all third-party dependencies within their codebase adhere to a single version. This approach is designed to prevent conflicts, such as the diamond dependency problem, which can arise when multiple versions of a library are used simultaneously.\n\nFurthermore, the One-Version Rule encourages developers to commit to a single version of a component within an organization, simplifying version control and enhancing overall engineering outcomes. It is rooted in the principle that a target should depend on only one version of a library to avoid conflicts and reduce complexity. By maintaining a single version of a package across all projects, the One-Version Rule aims to ensure consistency and reliability in software development practices.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
