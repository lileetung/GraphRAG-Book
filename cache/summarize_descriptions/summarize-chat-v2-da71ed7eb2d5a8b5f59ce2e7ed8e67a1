{"result": "Bazel is an open-source build system developed by Google, designed to ensure efficient and consistent code builds while avoiding trade-offs between speed and correctness. It is an evolution of Google's internal build tool, Blaze, and was made available to the public in 2015. Bazel focuses on managing project dependencies and visibility of targets, allowing users to compile source files and manage dependencies among various targets in a workspace.\n\nBazel employs a workspace-wide manifest file that includes cryptographic hashes to manage external dependencies, addressing the challenge of deterministic builds. It supports remote caching, which enhances artifact management and ensures consistent builds across different developers. The system is designed to handle large-scale projects efficiently, utilizing a functional programming paradigm to manage and rebuild software artifacts based on their inputs and outputs.\n\nThe build tool organizes projects into modules, optimizing dependency management and performance. It allows for the extension of supported target types by adding custom rules, which facilitates the definition of inputs, outputs, and actions. Bazel enforces strict transitive dependencies, particularly in Java code, and restricts dependencies on public APIs declared by programming languages, influencing software development practices.\n\nBazel utilizes sandboxing to isolate actions, preventing conflicts and ensuring that each action can only access its declared inputs and outputs. This approach guarantees reproducible builds and supports the automation of building and testing software, particularly in large codebases with external dependencies. The system also manages dependencies and toolchains, ensuring platform independence and promoting stability in software development by requiring manual specification of all dependency versions.\n\nOverall, Bazel is a highly scalable, artifact-based build system that enhances build efficiency through parallelism and reuse, making it suitable for projects of all sizes while addressing inherent issues in task-based systems.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
