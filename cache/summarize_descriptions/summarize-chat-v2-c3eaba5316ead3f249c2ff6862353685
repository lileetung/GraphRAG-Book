{"result": "The \"Infrastructure Teams\" are specialized groups within Google tasked with the critical responsibility of maintaining and upgrading the foundational systems that support software development and deployment. These teams play a vital role in the code review process, assisting local project owners with necessary changes and ensuring that updates are effectively managed. They possess the domain knowledge essential for executing migrations and updates, which includes making changes across the entire codebase while ensuring that these modifications do not adversely affect the product.\n\nAdditionally, Infrastructure Teams are responsible for managing internal user updates and ensuring backward compatibility, which is crucial for the seamless operation of software applications. They also handle the implementation of Local Software Changes (LSCs) and are dedicated to providing efficient tooling for code changes. Overall, Infrastructure Teams are integral to the software development process at Google, ensuring that the systems they manage are robust, reliable, and conducive to ongoing development efforts.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
