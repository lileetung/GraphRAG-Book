{"result": "LXC, or Linux Containers, is a technology utilized on Linux systems that offers lightweight virtualization capabilities. It enables the sandboxing feature employed by Bazel, allowing for isolated environments where applications can run. Additionally, LXC provides filesystem sandboxing, which permits actions to operate within a restricted view of the filesystem. This functionality enhances security and resource management by isolating processes and limiting their access to the broader system.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
