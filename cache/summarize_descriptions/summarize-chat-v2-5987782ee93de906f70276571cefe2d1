{"result": "Google is actively involved in the generation and management of Large-Scale Changes (LSCs) within its software development process. The company utilizes automated tooling to create LSCs, demonstrating a commitment to implementing substantial modifications efficiently. To ensure the quality and thoughtfulness of these changes, Google has established a structured oversight process that involves experienced engineers who review the changes before they are submitted. This careful management of LSCs is aimed at improving codebase management, and the approach has received widespread endorsement within the organization.\n\nOne notable example of an LSC undertaken by Google is the migration of its codebase from `scoped_ptr` to `std::unique_ptr`, which reflects a significant organizational effort to enhance the codebase. Overall, Google is responsible for managing and implementing LSCs, which are considered critical events in their codebase management strategy.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
