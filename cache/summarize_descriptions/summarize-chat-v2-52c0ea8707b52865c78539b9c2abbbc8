{"result": "External Dependencies are defined as relationships where modules rely on prebuilt artifacts instead of being built from source. These dependencies consist of artifacts that are built and stored outside of the build system, necessitating their direct import from an artifact repository. Additionally, External Dependencies encompass various libraries or tools that a project relies on, which can introduce complexities in version management and compatibility. Overall, External Dependencies play a crucial role in software development, impacting how projects are structured and maintained.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
