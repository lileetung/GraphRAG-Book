{"result": "LSC, or Large-Scale Change, refers to a significant modification in the codebase at Google that necessitates extensive testing, coordination among teams, and thorough review before submission to ensure safety and functionality. This structured approach has garnered widespread endorsement within the organization due to its historical success in improving processes. LSC involves a specific type of change proposal that requires review and approval from a designated committee, and it is managed through a lightweight approval process that engages experienced engineers.\n\nLSC encompasses large-scale changes that are logically related but cannot be submitted as a single atomic unit due to practical constraints. One notable example of an LSC is the migration from scoped_ptr to std::unique_ptr in the codebase, which represents the largest scale change attempted within Google. Additionally, LSC includes a system or organization responsible for managing codebase tests and ensuring the correctness of changes through automated tooling. Overall, LSC is a critical component of Google's development practices, aimed at maintaining high standards of code quality and functionality.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
