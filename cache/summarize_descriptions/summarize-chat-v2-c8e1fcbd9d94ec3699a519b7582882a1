{"result": "Software Systems are collections of code designed to perform specific functions, which can evolve over time. However, they may face challenges due to legacy systems that hinder their adaptability. These systems are technical frameworks that can become obsolete, necessitating deprecation to manage their lifecycle effectively. Additionally, software systems encompass various programs and applications that can be improved or replaced over time, influencing both functionality and maintenance. Overall, Software Systems represent a dynamic and complex landscape that requires ongoing management and updates to remain relevant and effective.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
